# Advent of Code

Dirty compact solutions to Advent of Code challenges.
Not sure if I withstand though... I'm already one day behind but who cares, I'm a busy man pche.

All code should be runnable with `runhaskell`.

```
$ cd 2019/day1
$ runhaskell Main.hs
```

## Rules

I imposed few rules one myself:

- no libraries (using only base) (This also means no containers or arrays or strings other then [Char] lol)
- no language extensions (Haskell 98 style)
- no shared modules between days
